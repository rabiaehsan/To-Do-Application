## Getting Started

I developed a feature-rich To-Do app using the GetX state management library. The app seamlessly integrates user authentication through Firebase, offering a smooth sign-in and sign-up process.

The app not only enables users to add, delete, and update tasks but also synchronizes these changes with a Firestore database. When a user adds a new task, it instantly gets stored in Firestore, ensuring real-time updates and seamless data management.

Moreover, the app guarantees that any modifications made to tasks, such as updates or deletions, reflect accurately and promptly within the Firestore database. This synchronization facilitates a seamless user experience, maintaining consistency across devices and ensuring data integrity.
